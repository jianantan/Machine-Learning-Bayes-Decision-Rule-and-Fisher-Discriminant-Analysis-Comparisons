# Machine-Learning-Bayes-Decision-Rule-and-Fisher-Discriminant-Analysis-Comparisons
Given a 3-class pattern classification problem, two classifiers, namely Bayes decision rule and Fisher 
discriminant analysis, are trained using the training data, and the class labels of the testing data are 
predicted. The data has four variables, and they are classified into three different classes.
